/pricing - menu: Harga & Program.

GET returns the whole screen in one payload, because the dashboard keeps the
program catalogue and the standalone price list side by side. PUT takes both
back in one body, because the editor is a single save button.

PUT is a diff, not a wipe. An earlier draft deleted every Program row before
re-inserting the payload, which is the obvious way to write "replace" and the
wrong one: `Enrollment.program_id` points at those rows, so every enrolled
client would have been left pointing at nothing while the price screen looked
perfectly healthy. So rows carrying an `id` are updated in place, rows without
one are inserted, and a row missing from the body is deleted - refused with a
409 when somebody is still enrolled in it, because that is a decision for a
person and not for a save button.
