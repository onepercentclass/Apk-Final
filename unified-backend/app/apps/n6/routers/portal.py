/portal - the client-facing view.

This is the only router a tier-4 client can reach, and the tier file lists
exactly these routes under ``endpoints.allow``. Everything here resolves from
``Account.client_id``, taken from the token and never from the query string, so
a client cannot reach another client's figures by editing a URL.

Writes are deliberately narrow: contact details and messages. Money, schedules
and staff records are not routed here at all, rather than being routed and
answering 403 - a 404 tells the caller nothing is possible, a 403 tells them to
look for a way round.
