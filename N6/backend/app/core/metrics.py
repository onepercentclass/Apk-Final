"""
Money and roster figures, defined once.

The Keuangan screen (finance.py), the monthly report (reports.py) and the
client portal card all answer variants of the same three questions: how much
came in, how much went out, how many clients were around. Three copies of those
sums is three chances for the dashboard to print two different profits in the
same month, which is the exact failure this module exists to prevent.

Every function takes a plain Session and a ``YYYY-MM`` string, so callers need
no ORM objects and no period objects.
