"""
/athletes - menu Atlet Binaan (head coach only).

One row per client per month, stored as AthleteNote. `PUT /athletes/{client_id}`
is an upsert keyed on (client_id, period): the screen edits all seven fields of
one row and saves in a single click, so there is no create/read split here.
The path parameter is the *client*, not the note, because the note id does not
exist until the first save and the screen never shows it.

Rows for reading, with attendance folded in, come from /monitoring/clients.
This router owns only the write, which keeps the "who may set targets" answer
in exactly one place.
