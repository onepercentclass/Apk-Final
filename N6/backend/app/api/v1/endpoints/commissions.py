"""
/commissions - menu: Performa & Komisi (owner only).

The tier files leave `commissions` empty for every tier below owner, so these
routes exist and answer 403 rather than 404. That keeps the reason in the
access rule instead of in the routing table.

A commission row is derived, not entered: gross comes from the month's paid
enrolments and amount from the coach's rate, so recalculating rebuilds the row
from the books and the number on the Performa screen can never drift from them.
