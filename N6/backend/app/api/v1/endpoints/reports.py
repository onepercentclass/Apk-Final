"""
/reports - the monthly PDF/JSON report behind the Laporan menu.

`GET /reports/monthly` lists reports that have already been generated.
`POST /reports/monthly` computes one and, unless `dry_run`, freezes it into
`monthly_reports.payload`. Freezing is deliberate: the payload is stored as it
was at generation time, so re-running for a corrected month creates a new row
rather than rewriting a document somebody has already been handed.

The PDF itself is still assembled in the browser by the jspdf bundle that came
with the dashboards. This endpoint produces the figures; the download button
draws them. Splitting it that way keeps the report layout in the file that
already has it, instead of duplicating it in Python and letting the two drift.
